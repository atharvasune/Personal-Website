              Hi, I am Atharva Sune. I am pursuing my bachelor's in Computer
              Science from BITS Pilani; right now in my final year.<br />
              I have always loved computers and the wonders we can do with them,
              create websites (like this), operating systems, applications,
              games,... there's just so much to do.<br />
              Recently I have developed a lot of interest in the field of
              artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. (Not
              just coding, math too :D) I am very much interested in developing
              websites, applications leveraging AI to make some awesome
              products.

            <p style="padding: 1% 0.5%">
              Well, right now I am in my final year undergrad at BITS Pilani and
              previously..
              <br />I have done a 2 month internship at Cateina Technologies,
              Mumbai as a software developer. I worked on developing a web
              application in there SHHHHH !!!. <br />
              I have also worked as a student researcher at IIIT Delhi (remote
              (COVID)) under Prof Tavpritesh Sethi, where I worked on deep
              learning and it's applications in bioinformatics.<br />
              I am excited to inform you that I have been offered a full time at
              Oracle India as an applications engineer, starting August 2021.<br /><br />
              Ohh I also had a startup with a couple of my friends, we were
              developing an application around an OCR pipeline. Alas we had to
              close it, for reasons known to us SHHHHH !!!
